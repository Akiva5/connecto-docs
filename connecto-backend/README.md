# Connecto Engine (Backend)

This repository contains the source code for the Connecto backend. It is built with Node.js and Firebase Functions.

## Purpose

This is the "Engine" layer of the Connecto project. It handles all core logic, including:
- Connecting to third-party services (Google, Notion, etc.).
- Syncing and indexing data into Firestore.
- Providing a secure API for the frontend application.

## Single Source of Truth

All project planning, documentation, and the overall roadmap are managed in the central `connecto-docs` repository.

**Please refer to the [main documentation](https://github.com/Akiva5/connecto-docs) for the complete project vision and current tasks.**
