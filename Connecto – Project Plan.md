# Connecto – Project Plan v3


1. Product Overview
Connecto is a personal data aggregation and visualization platform that unifies a user’s digital footprint from multiple services (email, messaging, files, tasks) into one secure, searchable, and user-controlled dashboard.
Core Value: Empower users to own, search, and analyze their data privately, with flexible syncing and advanced AI integrations.
Development Philosophy:
 * Initial Phase: Develop as a personal-use product to refine the core functionality and user experience.
 * Tools: Prioritize the use of free and cost-effective tools (e.g., free tiers of Firebase, Vercel) to minimize initial investment.
 * Architecture: Begin with a cloud-based web application for accessibility and rapid development. A local-first desktop version can be a future expansion.
Business Model (Future Goal):
 * Freemium Structure: The core data aggregation, search, and dashboard features will be free.
 * Premium Features: Advanced features, particularly those with recurring costs like LLM-powered summaries and analysis, will be part of a paid subscription tier.
2. MVP Feature Outline
The focus of the MVP is to deliver the core value proposition: a unified, searchable view of a user's data with full user control.
| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| OAuth Connectors | Connect securely to Gmail, Google Drive, WhatsApp exports, calendar, etc. | Must-have |
| Unified Search | Global search across all connected services and imported files. | Must-have |
| Basic Tagging | Manual tagging of contacts, files, and conversations. | Must-have |
| Data Import | Allow uploads of exported files (WhatsApp .txt, Google Takeout .json). | Must-have |
| Sync Control | Manual and scheduled syncing with user approval and a summary of changes. | Must-have |
| Data Privacy | Cloud-based data storage (Firestore) with robust encryption and clear, user-controlled permissions. | Must-have |
| Simple Dashboard | Overview of recent activity, storage usage, and sync status. | Must-have |
| Export Options | Export data or summaries in Markdown, JSON, OneNote, or Notion formats. | Nice-to-have |
| Basic AI Summaries | Limited-scope summaries using a cost-effective model (e.g., Gemini). | Nice-to-have |
3. Technical Architecture Overview
1. Frontend:
 * Framework: Next.js (Primary choice for a modern, performant web app).
 * Hosting: Vercel (Leverages their generous free tier and seamless integration with Next.js).
 * Authentication: Firebase Auth with Google OAuth.
2. Backend:
 * Platform: Firebase Functions for data processing, user auth, and API calls.
 * API Gateway: Handles user requests for search, tagging, and data extraction.
 * Data Pipelines: Pulls data from services like Gmail, Google Drive, etc., triggered by user actions or schedules.
3. Database & Storage:
 * Firestore: For structured data like user profiles, tags, and metadata references to files/messages.
 * Firebase Storage: For storing raw imported files (e.g., WhatsApp exports, images, PDFs).
 * Security: All user data will be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (Firebase default encryption).
4. UI/UX Philosophy: Building Trust
 * Transparency is Key: The UI must be explicitly clear about where data is, who can access it, and what it's being used for.
 * Visual Cues: Use icons and clear language to indicate the status of data (e.g., "Synced," "Processing," "Shared with AI").
 * Permission Prompts: Every action that involves sharing data (especially with third-party AIs) must be initiated by the user and confirmed through a clear, unambiguous prompt. The user should never be surprised by how their data is used.
 * No Hidden Actions: Avoid dark patterns. All settings should be easy to find and understand.
5. Suggested GitHub Project Structure
 * connecto-frontend: Contains all Next.js UI code, design assets, and UI tests.
 * connecto-backend: Firebase functions, API routes, data processing, sync logic, and LLM integrations.
 * connecto-integration-scripts: Standalone scripts for parsing complex data exports.
 * connecto-docs: Project documentation, API specs, design guidelines, and meeting notes.
6. Next Steps & Roadmap
 * Initial Prototyping (Figma / AI Studio):
   * Create clickable UI prototypes focusing on the user journey of building trust.
   * Key Screens: Onboarding (OAuth connections with clear permission scopes), Dashboard (showing sync status and data sources), and the Search interface.
 * Backend Setup (Firebase):
   * Set up a Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore, and Functions.
   * Implement the OAuth flows for Google as the first integration.
 * Sprint Planning & Roadmap (GitHub Projects):
   * Sprint 1: Prototype UI. Set up Firebase backend and Google OAuth.
   * Sprint 2: Implement backend logic for pulling and indexing Google Drive files and Gmail metadata.
   * Sprint 3: Build the unified search interface and basic dashboard.
   * Sprint 4: Refine UI/UX based on the "Building Trust" philosophy. Test and fix bugs for an internal MVP release.
7. Advanced Considerations & Strategic Opportunities
This section covers key challenges and opportunities to keep in mind as the project evolves from an idea to a functional product.
7.1. User Experience & Adoption
 * The "Aha!" Moment: The core value is finding signal in the noise. Design the onboarding experience to guide the user to their first successful cross-platform search as quickly as possible.
 * Performance is a Feature: A unified search bar is only magical if it's fast. Search speed must be a top priority in database indexing and backend design.
 * Onboarding Friction: Connecting multiple accounts is a chore. For each connection, clearly state the value proposition (e.g., "Connect Google Drive to find any document in seconds") before the user clicks "Connect."
7.2. Technical & Scalability
 * API Rate Limits & Costs: Every connected service has API rate limits. The backend must include robust error handling and exponential backoff strategies. Monitor API costs to ensure the freemium model remains viable.
 * Background Processing: Syncing large accounts requires long-running, resumable background jobs. This is a critical architectural component for reliability.
 * Data Schema Evolution: Plan for changes in the data model. Use a schema version number in Firestore documents (e.g., schema_version: 2) to manage migrations gracefully as new features and services are added.
 * Future-Proofing with Unified Standards (MCP): Keep an eye on emerging data portability standards, such as Google's Content Portability API. Adopting such standards (when mature) could drastically reduce the complexity and maintenance burden of managing dozens of individual, service-specific APIs.
7.3. Data, Privacy & Security
 * The "Break Glass" Scenario: As a central data hub, Connecto is a high-value target. Mandate Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all users to enhance security.
 * The Right to Be Forgotten: Implement a clear, verifiable process for completely wiping all of a user's data and files from the system upon account deletion. This is non-negotiable for building trust.
 * Dependency Risk: The platform's functionality is dependent on third-party APIs. Be prepared for policy changes or service shutdowns and be transparent with users about these risks.
7.4. Strategic & Long-Term
 * Defining Your Niche: Focus on an ideal initial user profile. Is it a busy professional, a freelance researcher, or a parent organizing family life? Solving a specific user's problems (e.g., a parent instantly finding a pediatrician's email from six months ago) will create a stronger initial product.
 * Building in Public: Consider sharing the development journey through a blog or social media. This can build a community of early adopters who are invested in the project's success and can provide invaluable feedback.
