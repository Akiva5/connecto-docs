## Connecto
> A personal data aggregation and visualization platform to unify your digital footprint into one secure, searchable, and user-controlled dashboard.
> 
Core Concept
In today's fragmented digital world, our data—conversations, files, tasks, and memories—is scattered across dozens of services. Connecto aims to solve this by providing a single, secure interface to bring it all together.
The core mission is to empower you to own, search, and analyze your data privately. By connecting services like Google Drive, Gmail, Notion, and more, Connecto creates a unified, searchable index of your digital life, all while putting you in complete control of your privacy and data permissions.
Key Features (MVP)
 * Unified Search: A global search bar to find anything across all connected services.
 * Secure Connectors: OAuth-based connections to your favorite services.
 * Sync Control: You decide when and what to sync. No surprises.
 * Privacy First: Built on a foundation of user-controlled permissions and data transparency.
 * Simple Dashboard: An at-a-glance overview of your recent digital activity.
 * Data Import/Export: Import data from exports (like WhatsApp chats) and export your data at any time.
Project Status
This project is currently in the planning and UI/UX prototyping phase. The foundational documentation and technical architecture are being defined here. Active code development has not yet begun.
The Vision
The long-term vision for Connecto is to become an indispensable tool for personal knowledge management, helping users find the signal in the noise of their digital lives and even enabling powerful, privacy-preserving AI integrations.
This repository contains all project documentation, design specifications, and strategic planning for Connecto.
